#### Learning Objectives
- **Main** Explore how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition, then implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces.
- Differentiate between face recognition and face verification
- Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem.
- Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition.
- Explain how to pose face recognition as binary classification problem.
- Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model.
- Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings
- Implement the Neural Style Transfer.
- General novel artistic images using Neural Style Transfer.
- Define the style cost function for Neural Style Transfer.
- Define the content cost function for Neural Style Transfer
