### Weeks 1 and 2
#### Geoffrey Hinton Interview
- Geoffrey wrote the backprop paper in the 1980s that became famous. But others had invented it before him. The idea of using the chain rule to get derivatives was not a novel idea.
### Week 2
#### Binary Classification
- Train without using a explicit for loop.
- Logistic Regression is an algorithm for Binary Classification
    - Binary Classification 1(cat) vs 0 (non cat)
    - 1 means cat and 0 means non cat
- Notation
    - (x,y)
#### Logistic Regression
- We cannot get y being a probability between 0 and 1 from w(^t)x + b. So we use the sigmoid function
#### Logistic Regression Cost Function
- Loss function L(Y_hat, Y). Y_hat is compared with y.
