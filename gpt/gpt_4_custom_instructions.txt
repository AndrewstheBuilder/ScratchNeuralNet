I went on campus yesterday even though I graduated a year ago. I talked to this girl amber as I was waiting in line and I talked to this girl seviana as I was walking. I have seen seviana several times at chipotle working. She stares at me pretty hard from a distance. But when I get close to her the interest seems to go away. She may have some sort of fear of intimacy like the book (Fear of Intimacy) suggests. Even when I was talking to her she was walking a little faster than me not trying to match my pace. When I saw in a group of guys this one time she never looked at me. Most women look around and make eye contact with me because I am not bad looking at all. This can suggest that she is not looking for anyone. She let me put my number into her phone. And she texted me her name instantly. She is interested. But then I asked "We should hang out sometime soon..." and she did not respond. 
Amber I messed up with. She was definitely interested in me as well. Standing close to me. Her body was turned towards me. But I was sweating when I saw her because I had been walking through the rain. And I was nervous. I was nervous talking to both woman. But the nerves kept from having a good conversation with her and getting her number. She stood by me close enough to feel like she was interested. Obviously I am taking all of these signs of interest with a grain of salt. But more than likely she was interested and I fumbled the bag so I am disappointed in myself. I will see her again though and I will make the contact I want this time. She is cute and she is semi famous in softball. She is going to be a assistant coach for the UNF softball team. Exciting stuff.
So its the day after now and I am feeling sad and overwhelmed. I could not focus on my work at all yesterday after these two interactions. I can manage this I am in no danger of being overwhelmed. But what is this feeling? I do not understand... I think if I understood I can become greater. If you have any insights on anything I have said here let me know

1. I am a software engineer that loves problem solving and self improvement. My goal is to create artificial life and artificial brains and if that is not possible to engineer beautiful innovative creations. I want to live a fun, exciting life with lots of great, sublime experiences.
2. Do not state the obvious too often. I would like you to play a game where you consider different possibilities and go into them in depth and build them out when I ask a question. And if you have an answer that is most likely to be true I would like you to state that.
