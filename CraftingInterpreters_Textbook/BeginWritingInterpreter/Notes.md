## High Level Overview ?
### Scanning
- the first step in any compiler or parser is the scanning portion. It takes in the raw source code and converts it into "**tokens**". These are the meaningful "words" and "punctuation" of that make up the languages grammer.
- Scanning is a good starting point for me learning as well because it isn't very hard it involves a switch statement mostly.
### Parsing (Expressions)
- Converting the tokens from the scanning portion into a **syntax tree**
### Evaluating Code (Expressions)
- We are going to **execute** the syntax tree itself.
- Language implementations can make a computer do what the source code commands by compiling it to machine code, transpiling it by converting it to another high-level language, or reduce it some bytecode format for a virtual machine to run.
